Building Pipeline:
1> Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).
3> Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dcv pipeline (without params)
5> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6> dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation.
    Note:
    a> Once dvc repor is execute successfully do 'git add dvc.lock' to add the changes for git tracking
    b> Check using command 'dvc dag' to see flow of execution
    c> The generated dvc lock file will generate a unique hash value for each update made for each stage
       This will help to revert back to a particular version through git, since we have added dvc.lock to tracking
7> Now git add, commit, push
