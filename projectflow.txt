Building Pipeline:
1> Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).
3> Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4> Now git add, commit, push
    Note:
    a> Incase we forget to add .gitignore while creating the repository, we can do that at a 
       later stage by adding a ".gitignore" file without any extension
    b> also to add any file/folder to .gitignore so that they are not tracked by git, use the below command format:
       git rm -r --cached 'reports\', which will untrack all files under 'reports'
       also, make sure to commit it like : git commit -m "stopped tracking reports"

Setting up dvc pipeline (without params)
5> Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
   Crash course on yaml in this repo: https://github.com/Arko2016/Learning-YAML-crashcourse
6> dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation.
    Note:
    a> Once dvc repor is execute successfully do 'git add dvc.lock' to add the changes for git tracking
    b> Check using command 'dvc dag' to see flow of execution
    c> The generated dvc lock file will generate a unique hash value for each update made for each stage
       This will help to revert back to a particular version through git, since we have added dvc.lock to tracking
7> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up dvc pipeline (with params)
8> add params.yaml file
9> Add the params setup (mentioned below)
10> Do "dvc repro" again to test the pipeline along with the params, followed by git add dvc.lock to continue git tracking
11> Now perform git add, commit, push
